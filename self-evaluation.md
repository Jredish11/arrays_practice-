# How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
Feeling pretty good about it. This lesson really helped break it down simply.  Feel like I'm recognizing the vocab and how to provide explanation & examples of code that demonstrate my understanding.  

# Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson? 
Any more coding challenges like we had in the conditionals lesson. Would love to do more with arrays in challenges like that.

# What questions do you have about Arrays?
So we can use string interpolation with defined variables, can we use it with a defined array variable?   

Commit your work.
